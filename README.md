## 🌟 Project Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive portfolio piece demonstrating mastery of advanced layout techniques in CSS, specifically focusing on creating a scalable and user-friendly interface. The core challenge was implementing a complex, real-world design that adapts flawlessly across all devices.

## 🚀 Key Features & Technical Skills

| Feature | Description | File Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Responsive Web Design (RWD)** | Layout adapts dynamically using **CSS Media Queries** to switch the video grid from 4 columns (desktop) to 2 columns (tablet) and 1 column (mobile). The sidebar also adjusts its width based on screen size. | `video.css`, `sidebar.css` |
| **CSS Grid Layout** | Used `display: grid` and the `1fr` unit to build the main video gallery, providing a flexible, two-dimensional structure for content arrangement. | `video.css`, `09_grid.html` |
| **Flexbox Integration** | Employed `display: flex` for precise alignment of items within components, such as the Header's left, middle, and right sections, and the profile/description alignment within each video card. | `header.css`, `video.css`, `10_flex.html` |
| **Fixed Positioning & Z-Index** | The Header and Sidebar are locked in place using `position: fixed`. The `z-index` property ensures the Header is always visible on top of the Sidebar and page content. | `header.css`, `sidebar.css`, `11_position.html` |
| **Advanced Interactivity** | Implemented interactive elements using **Pseudo-Classes** (`:hover` and `:active`): including functional tooltips, a hover-to-display notification count (`.number` class), and a complex channel profile hover card. | `header.css`, `video.css` |
| **HTML Structure & Semantics** | Proper use of core HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<a>`) and structuring content using `<div>` elements for grouping and layout control. | `html.html`, `07_div.html` |
